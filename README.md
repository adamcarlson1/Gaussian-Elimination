# Gaussian-Elimination
This code automates the process of expressing the solution of a linear system, including when that system does not have a unique solution.
Goals
The goals of this first programming assignment are:
1. To ensure you can convert the ideas of forward- and backward-phase elimination on a linear system.
2. To ensure you know how pivoting works and how a pivot location is found.
3. To ensure you know how to automate the process of expressing the solution of a linear system, including
when that system does not have a unique solution.
4. To provide a tool that will help you explore ideas in this course without having to repeatedly do hand
calculations.
